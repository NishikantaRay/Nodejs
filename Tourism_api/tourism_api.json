After dark, there is a grand sound-and-light show organised here with state-of-the-art projectors beaming laser rays on the stupa, narrating its grand history in 3D. From the time of the Kalinga empire to the feuds of the Mauryan empire, and the crowning of king Ashoka, the show covers it all in around 35 minutes. It ends with Ashoka adopting Buddhism, post the Kalinga War. In close proximity to the stupa are rock-cut caves and temples, including the temple of Dhavaleswara.",

Watching flocks of birds take off into the air in a coordinated pattern is mesmeric. The lake's shallow waters enclose large tracts of marshes, lowlands and islands, among which the most prominent are Nalbana Island and Kalijai Island. The Nalbana Island, with its wide variety of flora and fauna, forms the core of the Chilika Sanctuary. Kalijai Island is home to Goddess Kalijai, revered by local fishermen.

                "description":"The name 'Cuttack' is derived from the anglicised Sanskrit word 'Kataka', meaning military camp or seat of government. It also means the fort, referring to the ancient Barabati Fort, around which the city developed. Cuttack used to be the former capital of Odisha before the title passed on to Bhubaneswar, located about 25 km away. From pretty landscapes to a variety of activities, there is something here for everyone  be it a lover of shopping, history, archaeology or spirituality. One can visit Cuttack at any time of the year, but winter is considered to be the ideal time. Cuttack is the second-largest city in the state of Odisha and the headquarters of the Cuttack District. Its history goes back a 1,000 years and that is why it is also known as the Millennium City. Sometimes it is referred to as Silver City because of the beautiful filigree works made here. Cuttack is also well-known for woven textiles and horn works. As for food, the local dahibara is highly popular, along with chhena poda or rasgulla. Another interesting feature of the city is that this is where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was born. There are four rivers that run through this city, including the Mahanadi and its distributaries Kathajodi, Kuakhai and Birupa. Kathajodi river is further divided into Devi and Biluakhai. Cuttack is also hailed as the City of Brotherhood as people from all religions have been living here for centuries with a lot of affection and goodwill amongst each other.",

                "description":"On the banks of River Mahanadi lies Kantilo, a town about 100 km from Bhubaneswar. It is noted for being the home of a temple dedicated to Lord Nilamadhaba. The structure lies atop the twin hills of Brahmadri (this hill is well-known for offering a beautiful view of the sunset from the top) and Niladri and is surrounded by a forest. It is revered by those who worship Lord Jagannath and the presiding deity of the temple is believed to be an earlier form of Lord Jagannath of Puri. In the cult of Lord Jagannath, Lord Nilamadhaba is said to occupy a key position. In fact, in the Jagannath Puri Temple, Lord Nilamadhaba's shrine is present on the right side of the Lakshmi Temple. Since it's a miniature version of Puri's Sri Jagannath Temple, it follows the same rites and rituals. It is believed that a perennial flow of holy water emanates from the feet of Lord Nilamadhaba. The temple sees a large footfall during the celebrations of Maghasaptami  Bhaimaekadashi, in the month of Magha here.",

One can reach it by climbing 200 steps flanked with rows of champak trees. The cavernous interior of the temple enshrines a huge lingam and the cave is a multi-chambered structure. Its entrance is about 3 m wide and 2 m high. Inside the second cave, there is a large stalactite that is worshipped as the udder of Lord Kamadhenu (the divine cow).",

                "description":"Paradeep is a major port city in Odisha that lies at a distance of 104 km from Bhubaneswar. It is a municipality of Jagatsinghpur district in Odisha and boasts fine and expansive beaches that are a delight for travellers. There is also a lighthouse at the beach with a differential global positioning system. Apart from the blue waters, clear skies, sun-drenched evergreen forests and many miles of lush green grasslands that are crisscrossed by rivers and streams, Paradeep is well-known for its marine drive. The Muhana Point is an estuary point where River Mahanadi merges with the Bay of Bengal. Tourists can also visit the Smruti Udyan, dedicated to the memory of the people who lost their lives in the Super Cyclone of 1999. It has a beautiful musical fountain as well. The Paradip Marine Aquarium, the largest in Odisha, is also a must-visit and has 28 tanks containing different fish species.",

The town is also known for artisans who make brass and bell metalware, wood carvings and carpets. There are shrines dedicated to Thukurani, Jagannath and Nilakantheswar Shiva here, along with a museum that houses a collection of sculptures, and specimens of anthropological and natural history. Jaugarh, a popular place, is noteworthy because it is home to Ashokan rock edicts and other archaeological ruins. From this, one can conclude that the place was a part of Mauryan ruler Ashoka's empire, who was a proponent of Buddhism. Tourists can also relax in various beach resorts around the area.",

                "description":"Located on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar, Hirapur is a small town known for a hypaethral (open to the sky) temple of 64 Yoginis, called the Yogini Temple. It is said that the temple was hypaethral because the yogini cult used to worship the five natural elements: air, water, fire, earth and ether/sky. Dating back to the 9th century, this small temple is only the second of its kind in Odisha, and one of only four such temples in India. Another is located in Ranipur-Jharial in Bolangar District of Odisha. The other two such temples are in Madhya Pradesh. Its construction is attributed to Queen Hiradevi, the mother of King Subhakar Dev II, of the Bhaumakar dynasty. The yogini cult, in which yoga was practiced along with tantrism, is said to have flourished in India between 8th century AD and 13th century AD. In this, a chakra or wheel with 64 spokes used to be worshipped and Goddess Kali was the presiding deity. Believed to be offshoots of the Saptamatrika, the yoginis were vivacious and embraced life. They were said to be the reincarnations of Goddess Shakti and represented ultimate feminine power. The temple in Hirapur is a circular structure surrounded by a pond and leafy trees, and is unique for many reasons. It is the only temple to have statues on its outer walls. The nine sandstone statues stand for female figures. Each figure can be seen standing on a human head while holding a weapon in one hand. Their shape and form have led historians to believe that they might represent guardian deities. The main door to the shrine is very small. Inside, built into the circular wall, are 60 niches. All but one niche are home to tiny images of yogini goddesses. ",
